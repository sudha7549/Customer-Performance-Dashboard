# Customer-Performance-Dashboard


This repository contains a **Customer Performance Dashboard** built in **Power BI**, designed to deliver insights into customer behavior and segmentation based on attributes like gender, age group, and family status (with/without children).

The Power BI dashboard includes interactive visuals and dynamic metrics such as:
